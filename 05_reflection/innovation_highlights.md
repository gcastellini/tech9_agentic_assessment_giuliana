# 💡 Innovation Highlights

## 1. Agentic Collaboration Framework
The project demonstrates a scalable **multi-agent pattern** where specialized agents interact autonomously to perform complex analysis tasks.

## 2. Dynamic Web Intelligence
The `SearchAgent` integrates real-time web trend retrieval, turning static scripts into adaptive intelligence tools that stay current.

## 3. Unified Execution Logging
Dual-channel logging provides both **real-time console insights** and **persistent audit trails**, enhancing observability and production readiness.

## 4. Modular Extensibility
The design easily supports new agents (e.g., `ForecastAgent`, `DataQualityAgent`) without modifying the core orchestration logic.

## 5. Docker-Ready Design
All components are designed to operate seamlessly in containerized environments, ensuring reproducibility and easy deployment.
